# reclaim-sdk - Python SDK for Reclaim.ai

> **Migrating from 0.6.x to 0.7.0?** See `CHANGELOG.md` — enums moved, `user` param auto-resolved, new required Task fields.

⚠️ **WARNING: Major Changes in Version 0.5+** ⚠️

The codebase has undergone substantial modifications starting from version 0.5. These updates introduce breaking changes that may impact existing implementations. Please consult the documentation thoroughly before upgrading from earlier versions.

reclaim-sdk is a Python SDK designed for the Reclaim.ai API. It offers a straightforward and developer-friendly interface for managing tasks within Reclaim.ai. Please note that this SDK is not officially affiliated with Reclaim.ai and has been reverse-engineered from the Reclaim.ai web app, as well as utilizing the Swagger Spec provided by AJ from Reclaim.ai =>[Swagger Spec](https://api.app.reclaim.ai/swagger/reclaim-api-0.1.yml). Consequently, there may be bugs, and the API is subject to change without notice. Version stability is not guaranteed.

## Features

As of 0.7.0, reclaim-sdk covers:

- **Tasks** — full CRUD, planner actions (start/stop/snooze/plan-work/complete/log-work/etc.), batch operations, per-task reindex
- **Habits** — `DailyHabit` CRUD, planner actions (start/stop/restart/toggle/reschedule/skip), templates
- **Hours** — full CRUD on time schemes (custom day-hour intervals, `policyType`, features, target calendar)
- **Webhooks** — subscribe to task/habit events, typed payload models (`TaskWebhookEvent`, `HabitWebhookEvent`), HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- **Changelog** — read change feeds for tasks, events, habits, meetings, scheduling links
- **Smart Meetings** — full CRUD, planner actions (lock/unlock/skip/reschedule/move/clear-exceptions), series detection, convert from events

Not covered: Events, Calendars, Scheduling Links, One-on-Ones, Analytics, Focus Settings, Integrations, API-key management, Admin/Delegated access. Use the Reclaim web app or open an issue/PR.

**If something is missing for you, please open an issue or a pull request.**

## Installation
To install reclaim-sdk, simply run the following command:
```bash
pip install reclaim-sdk
```

## Configuration
You can get an API key from [here](https://app.reclaim.ai/settings/developer).

There are now two ways to configure the SDK with your API key:

1. Using the `RECLAIM_TOKEN` environment variable:
   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["RECLAIM_TOKEN"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

2. Using the new `configure` method:
   ```python
   from reclaim_sdk.client import ReclaimClient
   
   ReclaimClient.configure(token="YOUR_API_KEY")
   ```

The `configure` method allows you to set up the client with your API token (and optionally a base URL) at any point in your code before making API calls.

## Usage
The SDK uses Pydantic models for better type checking and data validation. Please refer to code examples below:

- [Task Management](/examples/task_management.py) — create/update/list/complete tasks + planner actions
- [Habit Management](/examples/habit_management.py) — list + toggle existing habits
- [Webhooks](/examples/webhooks.py) — subscribe + parse incoming payloads + verify signatures
- [Changelog](/examples/changelog.py) — poll change feeds
- [Hours](/examples/hours.py) — list / create / update / delete time schemes (custom working hours)

### Breaking changes from 0.6.x

- `TaskPriority` removed — use `PriorityLevel` from `reclaim_sdk.enums`
- Local enums on `Task` (`TaskStatus`, `EventCategory`, `EventColor`) moved to `reclaim_sdk.enums`
- `Task.list()` / `Task.get()` auto-inject the required `user` query parameter
- `Task` gained required fields `taskSource`, `readOnlyFields`, `sortKey`, `prioritizableType`, `type` — generally set server-side, leave defaults on create
- `task.event_sub_type` is now the `EventSubType` enum (not `str`)

See `CHANGELOG.md` for the full list.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or a pull request. If you want to add a new resource, please have a look at the [`BaseResource` class](/reclaim_sdk/resources/base.py). The [`Task` class](/reclaim_sdk/resources/task.py) is a good example of how to implement a new resource. Reference the [Swagger Spec](https://api.app.reclaim.ai/swagger/reclaim-api-0.1.yml) for the available endpoints and also use the network tab in the browser to see the request and response payloads, as the Swagger Spec may not always be up-to-date or complete.
